# Sonic Face

Playing instrument loops using OpenCV face detection and Sonic Pi.

## Getting started

Install [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/) and [Processing](https://processing.org/download/). 

Run the `.rb` file from Sonic Pi and then open the `.pde` file in Processing. You may need to install dependencies in Processing.

## How it works

Instruments are cued by the presence of faces. The `d` key can be used to debug, followed by the number of faces (5 for the maximum).
