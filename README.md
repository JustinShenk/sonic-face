### Sonic Pi + OpenCV

Playing instrument loops using face detection.

## Getting started

Install Sonic Pi and Processing. 

Run the `.rb` file from Sonic Pi and then open the `.pde` file in Processing. You may need to install dependencies in Processing.

## How it works

Instruments are cued by the presence of faces. The `d` key can be used to debug, followed by the number of faces (5 for the maximum).
